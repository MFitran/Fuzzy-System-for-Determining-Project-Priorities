# Fuzzy System for Determining Project Priorities Based on Budget, Duration, and Impact on Business

### Description:
This project aims to develop a project prioritization system using fuzzy logic, which can help companies select and prioritize projects more effectively amidst information uncertainty. In a competitive business environment, sound decisions are critical to a company's success.

### Main Components:
1. **Fuzzification:** Uses three input parameters (budget, duration, and business impact) to determine a project's priority value.
2. **Inference Rule:** Apply inference rules to relate input parameters to project priority outputs.
3. **Defuzzification:** Uses the Mamdani method to produce crisp values ​​from fuzzy output, providing results that are intuitive and easy to understand.
Results: This project shows how fuzzy systems can provide more adaptive and flexible solutions in project decision making, as well as increasing the efficiency of project management in companies.

### Technology Used:
1. Python (numpy, matplotlib)
2. Fuzzy logic method
